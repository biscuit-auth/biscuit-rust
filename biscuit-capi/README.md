## Biscuit C API

This crate provides a C API for the Biscuit token library. It is a wrapper around the Rust API, and is intended to be used by other languages that can interface with C.

### Building from sources

To build the C API, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed. You can then build the C API by running:

```sh
cargo cinstall --release --features="capi" --prefix=/path/to/install --destdir=/path/to/destdir
```
It will produce a shared library in the `--destdir` directory and also the C headers.
You can then link against the generated library in your C code.

`cargo cinstall` is provided by the [`cargo-c`](https://github.com/lu-zero/cargo-c/) crate, which you can install with `cargo install cargo-c`.

### Downloading pre-built binaries
In the [releases section](https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit-rust/releases) of this repository, you can find pre-built binaries for the C API.
Currently, only Linux x86_64 and MacOS (arm) are provided.

### Running the tests

```sh
cargo ctest --features="capi"
```
